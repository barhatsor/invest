## ❓ About
This started as an attempt to filter stocks by criteria (does the company give dividends < 5 years?).  
The problem was, to filter the stocks you had to have them all stacked neatly in your server. And it takes a whole lotta server power to gather stock info from lots of services and store it.  
Well, we did it somehow. Once we had all that data, though, we thought maybe we could do something more.
